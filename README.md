# Diabetes Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier
This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes in patients using a Decision Tree Classifier. The classifier is trained on a dataset containing various health metrics of individuals, and it can predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on these metrics.


## Setup :
  #### Clone the Repository:
  ~~~
    git clone https://github.com/sarthakkalia/diabetes-prediction-deployment-Decision-Tree.git
~~~
  #### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

  #### Install Dependencies:
  ~~~
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~
## Usage:
~~~
python app.py
~~~
## Model Evaluation:
  The Decision Tree Classifier's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the classifier is performing in predicting diabetes.
## Results:
After training and evaluating the model, you can expect to see the following results:
###### Accuracy: 74%
###### Precision: 75%
###### Recall: 83%
###### F1-score: 79%
